# Board game planner Python project

## Overview

In this project I organised a board game night event by analysing the availability of the guests and creating invitations using the following programming concepts:<br>
* lists
* dictionaries 
* functions
* for loops
* formatted letter strings
* some built-in functions 

A more detailed background about the project as well as the explanations for each code block can be found in the file.
